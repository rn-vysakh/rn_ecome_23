  "description": "<p>The Kodak i3000 Series Scanners are purpose-built to deliver consistent throughput and minimize downtime for your office. They're loaded with impressive imaging functionality for onboarding of information, and Intelligent Document Protection to defend against damaged documents and lost data. These A3 rotary scanners can take on virtually any challenge while taking up less space on your desk - making them the perfect fit for any business that doesn't have a second to waste.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Missions accomplished.</strong></p><p>The Kodak i3000 Series delivers consistently high throughput. Whether you're scanning in color or black and white, at 200 or 300 dpi, images, text or mixed-size documents - it doesn't matter, it just gets done.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Give productivity a major lift.</strong></p><p>Stack up the work. With a 250-sheet feeder/elevator you can neatly and efficiently scan large or small batches with ease. Our design ensures continuous throughput with rapid-fire scanning and less risk of jamming.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tear through work, not paper.</strong></p><p>Intelligent Document Protection is on duty for every document you scan. So scan fearlessly, with the assurance that your documents - and the information they contain - are protected.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Better than ever.</strong></p><p>Kodak's Perfect Page technology optimizes image quality and intelligently manages a host of image processing tasks. It all happens automatically, with every scan.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Intelligent by design.</strong></p><p>Scanning is really only half the story. Configuring image profiles, defining job names and file destinations, and distributing information are truly crucial. That's where Kodak's Smart Touch functionality takes over. It streamlines repetitive tasks like filing to your server, simplifies distribution of content, and makes access to your data easy, whether you're in the office or out on the road.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Works incredibly well with others.</strong></p><p>Easily integrates with all TWAIN, ISIS, and Linux-based scanning applications so managing your data is just as easy as scanning your documents.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Built to meet the demands of today and the rigors of tomorrow.</strong></p><p>Make no mistake, these scanners are made to last. Designed to impress your most experienced employees and make life easier for workers who are just getting started. When it comes to getting work done day after day, it depends on scanners that truly deliver.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Flexible input for inflexible documents.</strong></p><p>Some contracts are not just unbreakable, they're unbendable, too. For those instances, simply choose the straight-through paper path option. This bypasses rotary scanning, enabling you to feed thick or exceptionally long documents right through.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The impact made compact.</strong></p><p>Proof that a smaller design doesn't have to compromise features. We've managed to engineer heavy-duty features into a device that takes up less space on your desk and less time in your day.</p>",

  "description": "<p>The <strong>imageFORMULA DR-M140 Scanner</strong> from Canon features a fast 40 ppm (simplex) scan speed and up to 600 dpi resolution. The scanner is ideal for batch scanning large documents thanks to its ADF which allows for scanning 50 pages at a time. Additionally, the DR-M140 includes automatic duplex scanning so scanning a two-sided document doesn't require converting it to a one sided document before scanning. Easily reduce your paper clutter by scanning your files and creating searchable PDF documents. The included software guides you through the process of PDF creation and provides a file management solution to help keep track of all your scanned documents.</p><p><br></p><p>The DR-M140's compact size makes it ideal for any workspace. The scanner features a front loading and front ejecting paper path to eliminate the need for clearance space behind the scanner. Additionally, when not in use, the feeder and output tray fold into the scanner for an even smaller footprint. The printer also features a rear-feed straight-through paper path for scanning thicker media.</p><p><br></p><p>The DR-M140 comes bundled with a software suite that helps you get the most out of your scanner. Canon CaptureOnTouch provides an easy to use interface for scanning as well as a number of scan-to destinations such as cloud applications, PDF files, and Microsoft Office files. Nuance eCopy PDF Pro Office lets you create searchable PDF files so you can easily find exactly what you need. It also allows you to easily add pages to existing PDF files. Also included is Kofax VRS which provides image correction for your scanned documents and images.</p><p><br></p><p>WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS</p><p>Each day, legal, medical, government, and financial staff members are challenged with overwhelming amounts of paperwork. From invoices to letters and contracts to EKG strips, those in paper-based businesses require a document capture system that helps ensure efficient information management-that system starts with the DR-M140 scanner.</p><p><br></p><p>RELIABLE &amp; VERSATILE</p><p>Scanning often involves mixed batches of documents. To address widespread needs, the DR-M140 scanner employs two feeding paths. The default U-turn path works well for typical jobs, while the straight path can be selected to handle items such as thick or thin documents and embossed plastic cards. This scanner also offers pickup feeding for increased reliability upon initiating a scan, as well as Ultrasonic Double-Feed Detection to help ensure that no data is lost if a double-feed occurs</p><p><br></p><p>CONVENIENT &amp; EFFICIENT</p><p>The DR-M140 scanner is well suited for desktop use, reducing the space and the learning curve sometimes required to process documents. Its front-loading and front-eject features allow users to easily scan documents without a lengthy tray. A convenient control panel enables easy access to pre-programmed scanning tasks, and a Double-Feed Release button on the scanner body allows users to handle special documents, such as envelopes</p><p><br></p><p>PRODUCTIVE &amp; CAPABLE</p><p>The DR-M140 is equipped to scan 6,000 documents per day by holding 50 sheets in its feeder and scanning up to 40 pages/80 images per minute in all modes, including color. With such strong capacities, this scanner helps to effectively transition to a paperless office</p><p><br></p><p>HIGH IMAGE QUALITY</p><p>The DR-M140 scanner maximizes image quality with features such as Character Emphasis to improve the legibility of hard-to-capture documents. The Auto Resolution setting is useful for scanning mixed batches while automatically adjusting the resolution to improve clarity and compress file sizes. And with capabilities such as Background Smoothing and Shadow Cropping, the DR-M140 scanner emphasizes accurate scanning and furthers superb output</p><p><br></p><p>ENVIRONMENT IN MIND</p><p>The DR-M140 scanner is part of Canon's Generation Green Program. It also meets ENERGY STAR guidelines for energy efficiency and complies with the EU RoHS and WEEE directives for reduction of hazardous substances and waste products</p><p><br></p><p>COMPREHENSIVE SOFTWARE</p><p>With the DR-M140 scanner comes a suite of software applications. Canon's CaptureOnTouch helps simplify scanning tasks, and the improved CapturePerfect delivers advanced image processing features. Both also scan to cloud applications, such as Microsoft SharePoint, to improve collaboration. Also including Kofax VRS and Nuance eCopy PDF Pro Office, the bundled software package widens the scope of scanning capabilities. The DR-M140 scanner is also bundled with ISIS/TWAIN drivers for easy integration with third-party capture or content management systems</p>",

  "description": "<p><strong>Scanning Performance</strong></p><p>With duplex scanning speeds of 120 images per minute at 300 dpi in Color, Grayscale, and Monochrome, the fi-7160 protects your documents with acoustic sensors, ensures your data is captured with smart ultrasonic technology, and reduces rescans by cleaning up documents automatically in a single pass. Reliability is enhanced even further with new skew prevention technology for exceptional paper handling.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PaperStream IP (32/64 Bit)</strong></p><p>The PaperStream IP driver takes the work out of image cleanup when scanning invoices, ID cards, receipts, forms, or any other day to day paperwork. PaperStream IP automatically improves the image quality, removes unwanted backgrounds, and optimizes your scanned images for optical character recognition. It is fast and easy to use. Our latest innovation, Assisted Scan, allows users to replace poor images by visually selecting the image they lack rather than learning driver settings. If driver settings need to be adjusted for rare and difficult documents, our preview function allows scan operators to see their adjustments in real-time without time-consuming re-scans. PaperStream IP works with both ISIS and TWAIN applications.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PaperStream Capture</strong></p><p>PaperStream Capture makes advanced capture with Fujitsu scanners easier than before. PaperStream Capture has a streamlined User Interface to reduce training time and increase productivity. Not only have we provided users with the most common profiles used by customers - black and white, color, and auto-color new profiles are easily created or modified through a wizard. We have organized the release screen so that batches can easily be suspended or continued. PaperStream Capture is also integrated with PaperStream IP's assisted scanning for visual cleanup of documents. The reading of barcodes and patch codes make document separation easy, improving document organization.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>PaperStream Capture Pro</strong></p><p>A high-quality, front end scanning software, PaperStream Capture Pro enhances Fujitsu fi Series' superior scanning abilities with an improved feature set that includes options for high level data extraction and indexing, the import of electronic images, and support for multi-station licensing. PaperStream Capture Pro offers cost effective improvement tools such as PaperStream IP for optimized image capture. As a distributed capture model, this scanner software captures your data without added costs and resources. This solution benefits organizations and departments that require an efficient yet easy way to convert paper documents into a digital file for high level data indexing and extraction. Improve records management processes and drive down business expenses with PaperStream Capture Pro.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Centralized Efficiency</strong></p><p>Whether the infrastructure is fixed or expanding, managing technology efficiently inside the organization is key to reducing total cost of ownership and the Fujitsu scanner provides system administrators with advanced software tools to centrally manage the scanner more productively and cost effectively.</p>",

Smart features ensure the carrier sheet is instantly recognised by the scanner, so there's no need to adjust settings, saving valuable time. A3 documents are instantly recognised, and stiched back together digitally, ensuring a high quality scan every time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>EPSON ADVANCED CAPTURE</strong></p><p>For demanding scanning requirements and high-output environments, Epson's two-step scan process captures and sorts documents in seconds thanks to advanced, pre-defined parameters set by you.

  "description": "<p><strong>Compact and versatile scanner for the front office</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The fi-800R achieves scanning speeds of 40 ppm/80 ipm with ADF and 3.5 seconds per sheet with Manual Feed (A4 portrait, color, 200/300 dpi), and is capable of scanning up to as many as 4,500 sheets a day.</p><p><br></p><p>With its compact design, the scanner is ideal to use when space is limited, enabling better customer onboarding in spaces like reception desks and service counters. Its unique technologies assist both booklet scanning and continuous ADF document scanning with stable feeding, and reduce operator workload allowing users to provide better customer service.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Versatile scanning with space-saving design and stress-free usability</strong></p><p>The fi-800R is a ultra compact scanner designed to fit in any limited space. Equipped with Dual Path Mechanism, while Return Scan enables robust passport and ID card scanning, U-turn Scan enables continuous scanning. The scanner automatically switches to the appropriate path depending on the location that documents are loaded so that mixed batches can be scanned without stopping to change scanning paths or software profile settings.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Return Scan for passports and ID cards</strong></p><p>The Return Scan enables users to scan documents of up to 5 mm thick and complete start to finish in front of the scanner. Documents are ejected from where they were originally scanned in from, enabling users to scan and retrieve documents efficiently. Designed for reception-use, the device easily scans identification documents like passports, thick plastic cards, and folded documents, without a Carrier Sheet.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>U-turn Scan for fast continuous scanning with the footprint of half A4 size</strong></p><p>Equipped with ADF, the scanner scans A4-size documents continuously at a high speed of 40 ppm/80 ipm (color, 200 dpi/300 dpi). With U-turn Scan, documents are placed in from the top device to eject again from the top. The stacker automatically extends to provide neatly stacked output documents and returns to its original position once scanning has completed with Automatic Stacking Technology, so that users can easily start scanning their next batch. All these features enable the scanners space-saving design, allowing users to scan, organize and retrieve documents while multi-tasking with the other hand.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fast, reliable, and hassle-free scanning for a better customer experience</strong></p><p>The scanner has feeding mechanisms that ensure steady scanning eliminating the need to rescan documents. The Automatic Skew Correction, that corrects skewed documents one by one, prevents documents from jamming or a part of a scanned image from appearing missing, even when documents are roughly set.</p><p><br></p><p>*Available document size is A6 (width 105mm/4.1in.) or more.</p><p><br></p><p>The Active Separation structure prevents multifeed errors by applying an adjusted optimal amount of pressure to separate documents, according to the thickness or condition of a document to be scanned. It ensures steady scanning, which is perfect for a reception desk or service counter where precise scanning is required.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Advanced software improves workflow before and after scanning</strong></p><p>The functions of PaperStream IP and PaperStream Capture, scanner driver and capture software for fi Series respectively, improves operators overall productivity, by reducing the number of operations before and after scanning.</p><p><br></p><p>For passport and ID card scanning, personal information such as full name, document number, nationality, contained in the MRZ* (Machine Readable Zone), can be extracted for efficient entry of customer information.</p><p><br></p><p>*Supports recognition of MRZ on passports and ID cards, as defined by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). Passport MRZ layout is defined as two rows of 44 characters each (Doc 9303 TD3 format), and ID card MRZ layout as three rows of 30 characters (TD1 card).</p><p><br></p><p>The Front Side Detection function* automatically determines front and back side to organize scanned images in correct order based on the photo of a face on a passport or ID card, so that users do not have to check whether or not documents are scanned in facing upward.</p><p><br></p><p>*This function is supported by PaperStream IP V2.10 or later.</p><p><br></p><p>With the Automatic Profile Selection function that automatically determines the best profile for a document based on pre-registered formats of specific documents, users can produce the best scanned images without sorting documents beforehand or performing multiple scans with multiple application formats.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Customize and add to existing solutions for expanded use</strong></p><p>A compact design makes the fi-800R the perfect device to add to existing solutions. The scanner can be embedded into self-service or payment terminal kiosks in environments like hotels, hospitals, and banks to simply boost the efficiency of counter operations.</p>",
